name: Cleanup caches by a branch after PR was closed

#   The cache that we use is created directly for the branch and uses only there.
#   So we need to delete it manually after PR was closed, or it will stay until a repository has reached its maximum cache storage and only after that, the cache eviction policy will start to delete the oldest cache.
#   This script deletes the cache which was connected to this branch after PR was closed.
#   More information can be found here - https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/caching-dependencies-to-speed-up-workflows#force-deleting-cache-entries
